The goal is to brute force an HTTP login page.

Security level is currently: High.
On submitting the username and password we see that it is using get request

So letâ€™s use burp suite for brute force:
First i capture the request and then send that request to the intuder and their i set payload at username and password section
At the both section i uses my own username and password txt file

After setting all the things i started the brute forcing....

After the completion of brute forcing i the uniqe length in result

 And from that uniqe result i get the correct username and password.
